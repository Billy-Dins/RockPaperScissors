Guidelines

1. make a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    Important notes: -you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them.
                     -Use prompt() to get input from the user

3. Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
