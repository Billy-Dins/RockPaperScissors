## Odin Project
This page was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)
The intent of this project was to create a rock paper scissor game with buttons that allowed the user to make their selection, then put that selection up against a computers selection and displayed the winner. The results were then stored in a first to 5 in which the game ended and reset upon next playthrough.

The guidelines provided were as follows;

1. make a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    Important notes: -you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them.
                     -Use prompt() to get input from the user

3. Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

## Challenges
This was my first attempt with using a logic-based language so the obvious challenges in hindsight was just understanding the syntax to have the program do what I was asking it to do.
This problem exposed me to the idea of Pseudocode in which I would write in basic english what I wanted to code to do in a point form & step-by-step way. This allowed me to identify the syntax I didn't know and made problem solving much easier.
